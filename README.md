# Crash Out Detector (Seismometer)
### Intro 
I love watching rage compilations, and watching people slam their desks. and after reading this [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_ground_acceleration) on how severe earthquakes feel, I wanted to know the local effect of slamming your hands on a desk in the Mercalli scale. I will use an accelerometer to find the acceleration caused on items on my desk and interface with an LED array to display in real time what's going on on my desk.
### Accelerometers
I will use an accelerometer (the ADXL345)  to gather data on how much the stuff on my desk moves during a "crash-out". This device essentially tracks acceleration in 3 dimensions (x,y,z) and will send it back to the Arduino, which sends the data back to the PC for further processing.

### LED "Crash-out" Visualizer
It's essentially a vertical array of LED's...
