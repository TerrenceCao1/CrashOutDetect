# Crash Out Detector (Seismometer)
### Intro 
This thing detects desk slams and plots them on the Richter Scale
### Accelerometers
I will use an accelerometer (the ADXL345)  to gather data on how much the stuff on my desk moves during a "crash-out". This device essentially tracks acceleration in 3 dimensions (x,y,z) and will send it back to the Arduino, which sends the data back to the PC for further processing.

### LED "Crash-out" Visualizer
It's essentially a vertical array of LED's. In real time, the LED's will light up based on the intensity of the desk slam. 

### Outro
OK be on the lookout for a YouTube video. Goodbye.
