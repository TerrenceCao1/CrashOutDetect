# Crash Out Detector (Seismometer)
### Intro 
I love watching rage compilations, and watching people slam their desks. I want to know the local "earthquake intensity" that slamming your desk would cause. I will use an accelerometer to find the ground acceleration felt by  items on my desk and interface with an LED array to display in real time the earthquake intensity.
### Accelerometers
I will use an accelerometer (the ADXL345)  to gather data on how much the stuff on my desk moves during a "crash-out". This device essentially tracks acceleration in 3 dimensions (x,y,z) and will send it back to the Arduino, which sends the data back to the PC for further processing.

### LED "Crash-out" Visualizer
It's essentially a vertical array of LED's...
